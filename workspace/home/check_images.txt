Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ALexNet and VGG identified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as 'bull mastiff'. Resnet classified Dog_01.jpg as 'bull mastiff' and Dog_02.jpg as 'french bulldog'.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All three model identified images as non-dog images. lion picture was classified correctly as tiger(I used 'lion' name to check  the working) but all three were confused in classifying toy image.
For toy image : 
		VGG : pencil, Sharpener
        Alexnet : ocarina, sweet potato
        ResNet : piggy bank, penny bank


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: I will not choose Resnet as it missclassified the breed of Dog_02.jpg
VGG and AlexNet identified the dog images and classified them correctly. The non-dog images are classified as non-dog images. Tiger was identified as tiger but toy was identified as non-dog but all have different prediction. Even I don't know what was that. 
So given this, I will choose AlexNet as it takes least time(0:0:1).
